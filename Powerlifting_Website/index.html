        <h2>About Powerlifting</h2>
        <p>Powerlifting is a competitive sport that focuses on the squat, bench press, and deadlift to assess an athlete's overall strength and skill in each lift. The results are determined by a "total," which is the combined weight of the heaviest squat, bench press, and deadlift each athlete completes.</p>
