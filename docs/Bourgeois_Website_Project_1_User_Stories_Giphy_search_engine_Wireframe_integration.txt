User Flow:
Step 1: Landing Page

User arrives on the homepage, which features a prominent search bar and submit button. The site title is at the top.

Step 2: Input Search Term

The user enters a search keyword (e.g., "powerlifting") into the search bar and clicks the search button to submit.

Step 3: API Call

The site sends a request to the Giphy API using the entered keyword.

The API returns a list of related gifs.

Step 4: Display Results

The returned gifs are displayed in a grid layout (3-4 columns on desktop, 1 column on mobile).

Each gif is clickable, allowing the user to view the gifs in a larger format (optional).

Step 5: Interaction with Gifs (Optional)

User can click on any gif to view it in full size.

User can return to the search bar and try another keyword.

Step 6: Responsive Design

The page adjusts automatically depending on whether the user is on desktop or mobile.

On desktop, the gifs are arranged in a grid, while on mobile, the gifs are stacked vertically.



Conclusion:
This planning phase outlines the key user stories, page layout, and user flow for the Powerlifting Gif Search website. By following these guidelines, we will ensure that the site is functional, responsive, and user-friendly across all devices.
